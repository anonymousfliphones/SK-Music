# Changelog

## web — 2026-10-02

**Hover menu on every tile**
- Hover any album, artist or playlist tile and a **⋮** appears in its corner — the same idea as the
  **⋮** on a song, but for the whole set. Choose **Play**, **Shuffle**, **Play next**, **Add to queue**,
  **Start radio**, or (on an album) **Go to artist** without opening the page first.
- Song tiles (Trending Songs, New Songs, Keep Listening, and every other song rail) now get the same
  **⋮**, matching the one already on song rows.
- It respects your content filters: an artist or album they hide can't be played or queued from a tile.

## Desktop 1.2.4 — 2026-10-01

**Why the bump:** closing the desktop app with **X** didn't close it — the window hid to the tray and
the music kept playing in the background, so the app always seemed to still be running.

**Closing the app actually closes it**
- The window's **X** now quits SK Music completely and stops playback, the same as **Quit** in the
  tray menu. Before, it only hid the window to the tray and the song carried on.
- **Minimizing** is unchanged: the window minimizes and the mini player appears (while something is
  playing), so you can still keep music going with a small on-screen control.

## 1.8.7 — 2026-09-29 (web)

**Pop-up menus close on a second press**
- Pressing the button that opened a small pop-up menu — the sleep timer, a song's **⋮**, and the
  rest — now closes it again. Before, the second press closed the menu and then immediately reopened
  it, so the only way out was clicking somewhere else or pressing Escape.

## 1.8.6 — 2026-09-29 (web)

**Filter menu scrolls**
- The content-filter menu (filter icon, top right) is now capped to the window and scrolls on its own.
  On a shorter screen its last settings — Stream via proxy, Reset filters — used to hang off the
  bottom, and the mouse wheel scrolled the page behind the menu instead. Now the wheel scrolls the menu
  while you're over it, and stops at its end instead of carrying on into the page.

## 1.8.5 — 2026-09-29 (web)

**Light theme**
- New sun / moon button in the top-right corner, next to Sign in. Dark stays the default; tap the sun
  for a light, cream-and-rose theme across the whole app — sidebar, pages, menus, sign-in, the player
  bar and the full-screen player — and the moon to go back.
- The choice is remembered on this device and applied before the page draws, so there's no dark flash
  on load. It's separate from the content filters: Reset filters and Parental Controls don't touch it.
- The status viewer and full-screen video stay dark in both themes, like a photo viewer.
- The sleep-timer button in the full-screen player is now a **clock** instead of a moon, so it can't be
  mistaken for the new dark-mode button.


## 1.8.4 — 2026-09-29 (web)

**Search inside an artist**
- Every artist page now has its own search box under the Play / Shuffle buttons. Type part of a song
  name and the page narrows to that artist's matching **songs, videos, albums and singles** — nothing
  from other artists. Works with Hebrew titles too.
- Playing a result queues just the matches. Clearing the box brings the full page back.
- Results respect the same content filters as the page itself (Acapella, audio-only, and so on).

## 1.8.3 — 2026-09-29 (web)

**Go to album**
- The **⋮** menu on a song — including the one in the full-screen now-playing view — now has
  **Go to album**, next to Go to artist. It opens the album the song is on. When a song appears on
  more than one release, the artist's own full album wins over a single or someone else's compilation.
- Opening it from the now-playing view closes that view first, so the album page isn't hidden behind it.
- Songs that aren't on any album say so instead of opening an empty page.

## 1.8.2 — 2026-09-10 (web)

**Why the bump:** the horizontal rows had no way to scroll with a plain mouse. The scrollbars are
hidden, a wheel only scrolls up and down, and there was nothing to click — so on a desktop mouse the
rows were effectively stuck at their first few covers.

**Scrolling the rows with a mouse**
- **Drag them.** Grab anywhere on a row and throw it sideways. Clicks still work exactly as before —
  a press that doesn't travel plays the song; only a real drag is swallowed.
- **The wheel now scrolls sideways.** Point at a row and your scroll wheel moves it left and right.
  Once the row reaches its end the wheel goes back to scrolling the page, so you never get stuck in one.
- **Hover arrows.** Chevron buttons fade in at each end of a row, each one appearing only when there's
  more to see in that direction; a click pages across. They're mouse-only — nothing changes on a phone
  or tablet, where rows already swipe.
- Applies to every horizontal row: the home and detail-page card rails, Quick Picks, Zemer Radio,
  Statuses and Shorts.

**Also**
- Fixed the play button on a cover being positioned against the page instead of its own card. It only
  ever looked right because hovering a card happens to create the frame it was measured from.
- A row whose contents change without the row itself being rebuilt now re-checks its arrows, so a
  chevron can't linger on a row that has nothing left to scroll to.

## 1.8.1 — 2026-08-18 (web)

**Streaming setting renamed**
- The filter-bypass playback setting is now called **Stream via proxy** (was named after the upstream
  service). The behaviour is unchanged — it just no longer names the provider in the UI.

## 1.8.0 — 2026-08-18 (web)

**Why the bump:** on iPhone/iPad the music stopped the moment the screen locked, and there was no way
to control it from the lock screen. It now keeps playing in the background with full Now Playing controls.

**Background playback on iOS**
- Music keeps playing when you lock the screen or switch apps. iOS suspends the normal (YouTube) player
  in the background, so on iPhone/iPad SK Music now streams through a proxy, which iOS treats as
  real audio and keeps alive. This is automatic — there's nothing to turn on.
- The lock screen and Control Center now show the song, artist, artwork, a **draggable progress bar**, and
  skip / ±10s controls (this part also improves the Android media notification).

**Install it to your home screen (iOS)**
- iPhone/iPad Safari now shows a one-time tip: tap **Share** then **Add to Home Screen**. Installed, the
  app runs full-screen and background audio works best. The tip is dismissable and never shows once installed.

**Also**
- A **spinner** now shows on the play button while a song is buffering, on every platform.
- A **Clear** button in Up Next drops everything queued after the current song, and going *back* to the
  song that's already playing no longer restarts it from the beginning. Up Next is now usable on phones.

## 1.7.6 — 2026-08-17 (web)

**Why the bump:** on an unfiltered connection that was merely slow to start, the app announced
*"your filter blocks the normal player"* and switched itself to proxy streaming — and then kept
that choice across reloads, so a single slow start parked people on the relay for good.

**A slow start is no longer mistaken for a filter**
- The app used to decide the player was blocked after a fixed nine seconds. That timer cannot tell
  "blocked" from "slow", so on a slow but perfectly open connection it fired anyway.
- It now switches to proxy streaming only when the network has actually **refused** the player —
  never on a timeout. A slow start just says so, and offers the connection test and the manual
  switch, while the normal player carries on loading.
- When it does switch automatically, that lasts for the current visit only. It is never saved, so a
  one-off hiccup can't leave you on the relay next time. Turning it on **yourself** in the filter
  menu still sticks, exactly as before.
- Turning it off by hand always wins over an automatic switch.

## Desktop 1.2.3 — 2026-08-17

**Why the bump:** offline downloads failed with *"could not read the audio stream: no audio format
found"* for anyone whose filter blocks YouTube — which is much of this audience.

**Downloads now work behind a filter**
- The desktop downloader reads the audio stream by loading YouTube in a hidden window. When a
  filter blocks `youtube.com`, that window gets a block page instead, every way of finding the
  audio comes up empty, and the download failed with the message above.
- The web app already streams and downloads through a proxy in exactly this situation
  (1.7.5 below). The desktop downloader now falls back to the same relay whenever YouTube can't be
  read — a filter block, a timeout, or a YouTube-side change that breaks the reader — before it
  gives up.
- Nothing else about downloads changed: the file lands in the same library, in the same format
  (`.m4a`), and plays offline the same way. If YouTube *is* reachable, it's used first, as before.
- The fallback only accepts a real audio response. If a filter intercepts the relay too and hands
  back a web page, that is refused rather than saved into the library as a broken song.

## 1.7.5 — 2026-08-16 (web)

**Why the bump:** a large part of this audience sits behind a filter that blocks YouTube outright, so
the player never loaded and nothing played. There is now a way for them to listen.

**Playback for people whose filter blocks YouTube**
- When the normal player is found to be blocked, SK Music now switches to a streaming proxy
  automatically and the music plays — instead of only reporting that something is wrong.
- A **Stream via proxy** switch in the filter menu turns it on or off by hand. It stays off unless
  needed: the normal player is better when it is reachable.
- Switching keeps your place in the song rather than restarting it.

**Download now works in the browser**
- The Download button previously did nothing outside the desktop app. It now saves the track through
  the same relay, with a proper "Artist - Title" filename.

## web + desktop — 2026-08-16

**Security: remove unauthenticated `/dl` proxy endpoint**
- The `/dl?v=VIDEO_ID` Worker endpoint was an open proxy that could fetch audio for any YouTube
  video — bypassing the curated whitelist, burning request budget, and changing the service's
  exposure posture. The endpoint and all supporting code (`handleSongDownload`, `dlFetchInnertube`,
  `dlFetchWatchPage`, `dlPickAudio`, `dlResolveCipher`, `dlGetDecipher`, `dlBuildCipher`) have been
  removed. Web download buttons now show a "requires the desktop app" toast.

**Fix: desktop build — replace `futures` crate with `futures-util`**
- `Cargo.toml` declared `futures = "0.3"` but the lockfile never contained it, causing CI to fail.
  Replaced with `futures-util` (already in the dependency tree) which re-exports
  `FuturesUnordered` and `StreamExt`.

**Fix: parallel downloader strict chunk-length check**
- Changed the chunk size assertion from `n > expected` (allowed short reads silently) to
  `n != expected` — a short middle chunk now correctly errors instead of leaving a zero-filled
  hole in the pre-allocated file.

## web — 2026-08-16

**Fix: /download page now reliably loads installer buttons**
- The desktop-installer page (`/download`) previously fetched GitHub release data directly from
  `api.github.com` in the browser — subject to the 60 req/hr unauthenticated rate limit. When
  the limit was hit the download buttons silently failed to appear.
- Release data is now served through a new `/desktop-releases` Worker endpoint (edge-cached 10 min),
  eliminating the client-side rate-limit issue entirely.

## 1.2.2 — 2026-08-16 (desktop)

**Why the bump:** offline downloads were slow — the downloader fetched one chunk at a time.

**Downloads are now faster (parallel range requests)**
- The audio downloader now uses 3 concurrent range requests (2 MiB each) instead of a single
  sequential stream, improving download speed while staying under YouTube's throttle heuristic.
- Each chunk strictly asserts HTTP 206; a server that ignores Range is detected and handled via a
  sequential fallback path — this prevents silent file corruption.
- Per-chunk retries (up to 2) for transient failures (429, 403, 5xx, network errors).
- File I/O moved to blocking threads to avoid stalling the async runtime.
- Falls back gracefully to a single-stream download if the server doesn't support Range requests.

## web — 2026-08-16

**The /download page now has proper OG/social metadata**
- Sharing or linking to `/download` now renders the correct title and description in social cards,
  search results, and link previews (was previously falling through with generic site metadata).

## 1.7.4 — 2026-08-15 (web; affects the desktop app)

**Why the bump:** the download dialog was opening behind the screen you started it from, so it — and
every message it carries — was invisible.

**The download dialog now appears in front**
- The download button only exists on the full-screen Now Playing view, but the dialog was stacked
  *below* it. Tapping Download therefore looked like it did nothing at all.
- Everything the dialog carries was hidden with it: the progress bar, the "Saved for offline"
  confirmation, **the reason a download failed**, and the Retry button. If a download has been
  failing for you, the explanation was there the whole time — behind the player.
- The dialog and the Downloads list now sit above the player, the statuses viewer, toasts and menus.

## 1.7.3 — 2026-08-15 (web)

**Why the bump:** when someone's internet filter blocked playback, they saw nothing play and left —
and there was no way to know how often that happened or what exactly was being blocked.

**When playback is blocked, the app now points at the connection test**
- Both "playback isn't working" paths — the player never loading, and three tracks failing in a row —
  now link straight to **/test**, instead of only saying that something is wrong.

**The connection test reports what it found**
- After a run, /test sends its verdict and the pass/fail of each individual check back to the site's
  own analytics. Nobody has to copy the log and send it in for the problem to be visible.
- Only the per-check verdicts travel — never the log text or any page contents.

**New: Filter-blocked users on the analytics page**
- A headline figure for how many **people** (not attempts) couldn't play music because their filter
  blocks it, as a share of visitors, including how many are on Techloq.
- Alongside it, counts of connection-test runs by verdict, and a panel showing **which checks fail
  most often** — the thumbnails host, the catalog API, and so on. That is the list to hand to whoever
  manages the filter.

## 1.7.2 — 2026-08-15 (web)

**Why the bump:** AI training crawlers were **89% of all traffic** — 38,721 of 43,675 requests
in a measured six-hour window, nearly all of it Meta's `meta-externalagent`. They were pushing the
account past its daily request limit roughly every other day, and they aim at the most expensive
pages on the site.

**AI crawlers are turned away; search engines are not**
- `robots.txt` now disallows the AI/LLM training crawlers by name (Meta, GPTBot, ClaudeBot,
  CCBot, Bytespider, PerplexityBot and friends). This is the part that actually removes the
  traffic — a crawler that obeys it stops asking.
- The Worker refuses them directly too, for the ones that ignore `robots.txt`, before it does any
  of the expensive page-building work.
- **Google and Bing search are untouched and still index everything**, so nothing about how the
  site is found changes. `Google-Extended` is disallowed, but that is Google's separate
  AI-training crawler, not the search one.
- `robots.txt` itself stays readable by everyone, including the blocked crawlers — otherwise they
  could never learn to stop.

*(This release also carries the playback fix written up under 1.7.1 below, which had not yet
shipped.)*

## 1.7.1 — 2026-08-13 (web)

**Why the bump:** on a filtered network, playback didn't just fail — it got stuck. One track failing
poisoned the whole session, and the app never said why.

**Playback on a filtered network**
- If the YouTube player was slow to load, the app gave up after 9 seconds and switched to an old
  `/stream` address that this site has never had a server for. That switch was permanent: even when
  the player turned up a second later, every song for the rest of the session was sent to the dead
  address, and nothing played until the page was reloaded. The player now stays in place and simply
  starts playing whenever it's ready.
- That dead address answered with the app's own home page, so the audio player was handed a web page
  and told to play it. It sat there loading, then failed with no explanation. It now answers
  immediately and honestly, so a blocked track fails in milliseconds instead of hanging.
- When playback really is blocked, the app now says so once — *"Playback is blocked on this network"* —
  and links to the connection test that identifies exactly which part is being blocked, instead of
  silently retrying and giving up.
- Search, browse and everything else keep working throughout, as before.

## 1.7.0 — 2026-08-05 (web + desktop 1.2.1)

**Why the bump:** SK Music now has one address — **https://skmusic.shalomkarr.com** — and everything
else points at it.

**The site has a proper domain**
- `skmusic.shalomkarr.com` is the canonical address. The old `…workers.dev` address still works and
  now forwards to it, keeping the rest of the link intact: a link to `/songs/abc` on the old address
  lands on `/songs/abc` on the new one.
- Everything that names the site — every sitemap entry, every shareable link preview, the search-engine
  canonical tags on all 1,625 artist and 1,855 playlist pages — now says the new address.

**Desktop 1.2.1**
- The app opens the new address directly and accepts links to either address, so anything shared
  before today still opens the right page.
- **If you installed 1.2.0, please update.** 1.2.0 only trusts the old address, so when it gets
  forwarded to the new one it loses media keys, downloads, the update check and the new auto-dip
  until it's updated. Checking for updates still works, which is how it repairs itself.

## Desktop 1.2.0 — 2026-08-04

**Why the bump:** the first desktop release since 1.1.3, carrying two things that only the native app
can do.

**New — the music dips instead of you pausing it**
- See 1.6.1 below. When something else on the computer makes sound — a voice note, a call, a video —
  the music turns itself down and comes back afterwards, including while you're talking into the mic.

**Faster launch**
- The connectivity check used to run *after* the window had already come up, adding a full round trip
  to every start. It now runs alongside the window opening and finishes in 20–60 ms instead of
  250–370 ms, with a 3-second ceiling instead of 9. Shell-to-interactive dropped about 30%.
- The app shell is served from cache first and refreshed in the background, so launching no longer
  re-downloads a page it already had.

*(Both were written earlier — 1.5.2 — but a desktop release is what actually delivers them.)*

## 1.6.1 — 2026-08-04 (web; desktop feature ships in Desktop 1.2.0)

**New — the music dips instead of you pausing it (desktop app)**
- When something else on your computer starts making sound — a WhatsApp voice note, a call, a video —
  SK Music turns itself down, and turns back up when it stops. No more pausing and un-pausing all day.
- It also dips while you're **talking into the microphone**, so recording a voice note doesn't mean
  reaching for the volume first.
- On by default, with a switch and a "how much" slider in the filters menu (Playback). Default is 75%
  quieter.
- Your volume slider never moves. The dip is applied on top of wherever you left it, so if you change
  the volume mid-dip it goes back to the level *you* chose, not the one from before.
- Muting still means muted — a dip can't un-mute you.
- **Desktop only.** A browser tab can't see other applications' audio at all, so the control is hidden
  in the web app rather than shown doing nothing.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-08-03 (web)

**Why the bump:** the same artist could appear two or three times, because one person can hold several
YouTube channels and the catalog is keyed on the channel. There are **47 names spread across 95
channels** — 5.8% of the artist list. Abie Rotenberg has three.

**New — merge duplicate artists (admin)**
- `/admin` now finds duplicates itself, by matching names and by spotting channels sharing an
  identical profile picture (the same person re-uploading a channel keeps the photo, and sometimes
  changes the spelling). Pick which one to keep and merge the rest into it.
- The duplicate stops appearing separately in browse, search and every artist rail, **and its songs,
  albums and playlists move onto the surviving artist's page.** Nothing is hidden and nothing is lost
  — verified on a real pair: 43 songs + 20 songs became one page of 63, with all 5 albums.
- Old links to the merged-away channel keep working and quietly correct themselves to the surviving
  artist, so anything already shared or bookmarked doesn't break.
- Reversible at any time from the same screen.
- A merge is applied when the site is next built, so it costs nothing at all while people are using
  the app. The live site is unchanged until the next deploy — the admin screen says so.
- **Requires running `supabase/v1.2.8-artist-merge.sql`.** Until then the merge panel says so plainly
  and everything else works as before.

## 1.5.3 — 2026-08-03 (web)

**Why the bump:** a latency pass over every tab, after the Home fix in 1.5.2.

**Faster**
- Home no longer waits for the Zemer rows at the bottom of the page either. They come from an outside
  server (~480ms) and sit below everything else, so waiting on them delayed the whole page for
  content nothing had scrolled to. Home now paints and fills them in.
- Large artwork decodes off the main thread. This matters most on Shiurim: TorahAnytime serves one
  fixed image size and ignores resize requests, so a single lecture thumbnail can be **1 MB** for a
  picture drawn at thumbnail size. Nothing looks different; the page just stops hitching while they
  decode.

**Measured, for the record** (production, warm): Shiurim 2.3s to content, Artists 2.4s, Home 1.8s
before this change. The remaining cost on Shiurim is image weight from TorahAnytime, which can't be
resized at the source — noted as a known limitation rather than fixed.

## 1.5.2 — 2026-08-03 (web)

**Why the bump:** Home was waiting on other people's servers before it would draw anything, the share
button wouldn't let you just copy a link, and the analytics dashboard was showing "NaN%".

**Faster — Home no longer waits on Zemer Radio or Statuses**
- Both of those come from outside SK Music, and Home was holding its entire first paint until the
  slower of them answered — so one sluggish upstream delayed everything, including the music.
- They now load alongside the page and drop into their reserved places when they arrive. Measured
  with those two calls artificially slowed to 5 seconds, Home painted in **0.5s** — previously it
  would have sat empty for the full 5. Nothing else got slower; they still start at the same moment.
- The Statuses row itself also gives up on a stalled category after 6 seconds instead of 15. A
  category that times out was already skipped, so this only ever trades a few extra faces for a row
  that shows up.

**Share — copy the link, or use your device's share sheet**
- The share button used to jump straight to the system share sheet wherever one existed, so on a
  phone or the desktop app there was no way to simply copy a link. It now offers both.
- The now-playing share menu keeps "start at the current time" and offers it for either destination.
- On a browser with no share sheet, it's a copy-only menu — exactly what it did before.

**Fixed — analytics "Signed in vs anonymous" read 0 accounts and NaN%**
- The card was only ever populated on the slow fallback path. On the fast path the numbers were
  simply absent, so the percentages divided by nothing.
- It now reads the split from the dashboard summary, measured over the same range as every other tile
  on the page. Where that hasn't been redeployed yet it falls back to the older whole-day figure and
  says so, rather than showing zeroes.
- A stat that can't be computed now shows "—" instead of "NaN%".
- **Requires re-running `supabase/dashboard-summary.sql`** for the exact per-range numbers.

## 1.5.1 — 2026-08-03 (web)

**Why the bump:** filmed shiurim stuttered and froze for some people. The cause was the video file
format, not the connection, and the fix is to stream a different rendition of the same lecture.

**Fixed — video shiurim froze and stuttered**
- TorahAnytime's downloadable MP4 is not "faststart": the 330 KB index a player needs *before* it can
  show anything sits at the **end** of the file, after ~26 MB of video. On a fast connection the
  browser grabs just that tail and it plays. On a slow one — or behind a filter that inspects traffic
  and interferes with partial downloads — the browser ends up pulling the whole 26 MB before the first
  frame, which is what the freezing was.
- Watching now uses the **streaming version** of the same lecture: 77 short segments with the index at
  the front, in three qualities. A weak connection steps down to a lower quality instead of stalling,
  and playback starts after roughly 300 KB rather than 26 MB.
- The old file is still the fallback. If streaming can't start for any reason, the video plays the way
  it did before — slower to begin, but never broken.
- Lectures that are only available as video are now offered too; they were previously skipped.

**Under the hood**
- The streaming player is downloaded **only the first time you watch something**, and never for music,
  audio shiurim, podcasts or statuses.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-08-02 (web)

**Why the bump:** the Shiurim surface grew a real home page, video playback and a language filter; the
Podcasts tab was rebuilt to match; search now reaches every surface; and the desktop shell stopped
waiting on a network probe before it would paint. Web-only — the desktop version is unchanged, so this
does not ship a new installer.

**Shiurim**
- The tab now reads like Home: hero, language chips, and self-hiding sections — Resume listening,
  Trending, Shorts, Trending speakers, For You, Speakers, Browse by topic, Newest, Daily & ongoing,
  Series. The whole page costs **three** TorahAnytime calls and **zero** Worker requests.
- **Watch a shiur as video.** Lectures that were filmed now offer a Watch toggle. Switching between
  audio and video keeps your position, and Media Session / taskbar controls follow whichever is playing.
- **Filter by language.** Twelve languages, defaulting to **All** — turning it on can only narrow what
  you already saw. A lecture or speaker whose language we don't know stays visible: "unknown" is not
  "wrong language," and hiding those would quietly empty the older feeds.
- **Browse everything.** `/shiurim/speakers`, `/shiurim/topics` and `/shiurim/series` list the full
  catalog with instant search, all matched client-side against baked data.
- **The speaker directory more than doubled** — 1,341 speakers, up from 577, now including guest
  speakers. Browse shows non-guests plus guests with a real body of work; search reaches all 1,341.
  The full list is a separate lazily-fetched asset, so the Shiurim page doesn't pay for it up front.
- **Shorts** (TorahAnytime clips) play through the existing Statuses viewer, grouped by speaker.

**Podcasts**
- Rebuilt with the same shelf treatment: Continue listening, Quick Picks, Podcasters, Because you
  listened to…, Under 20 minutes, Your shows, New episodes, Most active shows, Shows to discover, and
  All shows. Every section hides itself when empty. Still **one** request for the whole tab.
- Episode rows gained the music player's anatomy — playing state, duration column, hover play, and a
  resume bar.
- A new local history means Continue listening survives an episode falling out of the live feed. It is
  re-checked against your filters on every read and **fails closed**: a show that is now blocked never
  comes back through history.

**Search**
- Search now covers **podcasts, shiurim and statuses** alongside music, with chips to narrow to one.
  Everything but shiur lectures is matched client-side against baked data, so a search still costs
  **zero** Worker requests. A surface that is switched off is never queried at all.
- Podcast *episodes* are deliberately not searched — that is the one thing that would cost a request
  per keystroke. Matching the show and letting you open it is one click and free.

**Desktop**
- **Faster launch.** The connectivity check used to run *after* the window had already booted, adding a
  full round trip to every start. It now runs in Rust alongside WebView2 startup and finishes in
  20–60 ms instead of 250–370 ms, with a 3-second ceiling instead of 9. Shell-to-interactive dropped
  about 30%.
- The app shell is now served from cache first and refreshed in the background, so a launch no longer
  re-downloads a page it already had. A new build still takes over automatically.

**Fixed**
- Playing a shiur or podcast episode could route through media hosts the Content-Security-Policy did
  not allow, which silently killed playback for a handful of older lectures. The allowed list now
  matches what the code actually contacts.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-08-02 (web + desktop)

**Why the bump:** two new listening surfaces, a filter leak closed, and four bugs found in the podcasts
code that shipped earlier the same day.

**Fixed — Zemer Radio was leaking past a content filter**
- Upstream added genre-pooled stations (**Nigunim**, **Chill**) alongside the artist-flag ones. The gate
  treated any unrecognised station as making "no style claim" and **showed it** — so a user with **Hide
  Chasidish** was being offered Nigunim Radio, which is the chasidish pool by definition. Unrecognised
  stations are now **hidden**, matching the fail-closed rule used everywhere else. Chill is explicitly
  classified as making no style claim, which is a different thing from unknown. The Parental Controls
  picker now derives from the same map, so the two lists can't drift apart again.

**Fixed — podcasts (four real bugs)**
- **A shiur would roll into music.** A one-episode queue looked like "last track" to the radio prefetch,
  which fetched a station from the episode's id and appended songs.
- **The Podcasts tab went blank during Sefira and the Three Weeks** — the Acapella gate demanded playlist
  membership no spoken word has. Episodes now use their own filter.
- Every episode row read fields that don't exist, so subtitles, durations and resume bars never drew.
- Two colliding `shareSong` declarations meant the now-playing menu shared a bare `/song/` URL.

**Podcasts — podcasters, series, video policy**
- A **Podcasters** rail, **series** pages, and episode pages naming the podcaster with more from that
  show and host alongside. **Video shiurim** are a separate opt-in; audio-only episodes are unaffected.
- The show list is **baked at build time**, so the tab costs **one** Worker request. Upstream does not
  kol-isha-filter podcasts, so the client does it from the whitelist flags.

**Shiurim (new) — TorahAnytime**
- Browse by topic, speaker and series, search, newest and trending, with per-lecture resume. **Off by
  default**, enabled by a parent, then switchable per account.
- **Costs zero Worker requests** — the browser talks to TorahAnytime directly and streams from source;
  the catalog is baked into the build. Kol isha is enforced per record, and a lecture or speaker marked
  no-download is never offered a save.

**Statuses — it moves like a story now**
- Sliding transitions between posts, a cube turn between creators, continuous progress bars, and
  open/close anchored to the circle you tapped. All of it respects reduced-motion. Two rows past 20.

**Downloads (desktop)**
- A **progress dialog** that stays until the download finishes, then offers **Show in folder**. Failures
  show the reason with a Retry, and a stalled download becomes a retryable error rather than a hang.
- The web side never sends a file path to the app — it sends the song id and the app resolves the path.

**For You is gone.** Its personalised sections were a second home page; `/foryou` redirects to Home.

**Known gaps, stated rather than hidden**
- The podcast **video** setting has nothing to filter yet — upstream doesn't mark episodes as video.
- The Shiurim **build-time bake has not run end-to-end** (`build:code` skips the data step). It fails
  soft if TorahAnytime is unreachable.
- **Desktop-native paths are untested** for shiurim and for Show-in-folder.
- `playIndex` still evicts **podcast episodes** during Sefira; `regateQueue` exempts them and it does not.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-08-02 (web only — no desktop rebuild)

**Why the bump:** two new content surfaces, both **off by default and unlocked by a parent**. Neither
appears for anyone who doesn't deliberately turn it on.

**Podcasts & Shiurim (new)**
- The Podcasts tab is real. New episodes from whitelisted shows, filtered by the same rules as the
  music — kol isha, Chasidish, Israeli and DJ settings all still apply.
- **Off until enabled.** `filters.podcasts` is opt-*in*: a new account, a signed-out device, or any
  account a parent hasn't configured gets nothing, and the tab is **absent from the sidebar** rather
  than shown-and-disabled. A parent enables it in Parental Controls (PIN-gated); the account then gets
  its own Settings switch. Turning it off while someone is on the tab returns them Home.
- **Episodes remember where you were.** A shiur is an hour, not four minutes, so there's a per-episode
  resume point with a Continue Listening section and progress bars. The first 30 seconds are ignored —
  that isn't a resume point.
- Playback is the existing engine, so background play, media keys, tray controls and the desktop mini
  player all work with episodes unchanged.

**Statuses (new)**
- A row of story circles on Home under Quick Picks, with a full-screen viewer: auto-advance, tap or
  arrow navigation, press-and-hold to pause, resume at the first unseen, and seen-state that persists.
- Music pauses when the viewer opens and resumes on close — and only if something was actually playing.
- **Same gating as podcasts**: off until a parent enables it, then an account-level switch. Hidden
  entirely in Kid Zone.

**Worker**
- New same-origin proxies: `/podcasts/new-episodes`, `/podcast`, `/podcast-channel`,
  `/podcasts-whitelist` (+ `/version`), and `/statuses/creators`, `/statuses/posts`, `/statuses/media`.
  All rebuild the upstream query from a validated allowlist rather than forwarding the query string,
  matching the existing `/radio` hardening. Credentials stay server-side — nothing reaches the client.
- `content.zemer.io` is a new upstream host, used only for the podcast whitelist mirror.

**Known limits, stated rather than hidden**
- The `blockVideos()` gate is wired for statuses but currently unreachable — that filter is hardcoded
  off in the UI today, so it protects nothing until it's restored.
- Statuses hasn't been exercised on real touch hardware or iOS Safari; the tap zones and the muted
  autoplay fallback were verified with synthetic events only.

## 1.2.7 — 2026-07-30 (web only — no desktop rebuild)

**Playlist cover art**
- **Pick a cover for any playlist** — a Cover button on the playlist page opens a grid of that
  playlist's own songs; tap one to make its artwork the cover, or reset to the first song.
- Playlists in your Library and the playlist page itself now show real artwork instead of a generic
  glyph. **No one has to choose one** — with no explicit pick, the first track's art stands in.
- A cover is one of the playlist's own songs rather than an upload: no storage, no arbitrary URLs and
  nothing to moderate. The server re-checks membership, so a cover can't be set to a song that isn't
  in the playlist.

**Playlist rename**
- **Renaming works.** The rename always reached the database — but the Library list is cached and was
  never invalidated, so the old name kept rendering exactly where you'd look to check. Deleting
  already refreshed that list; renaming didn't.
- Underneath it, a broader fix: every `returns void` RPC (rename, delete, add, remove, reorder)
  replies `204` with an empty body, and the client's JSON parse threw on that — so **success was being
  reported as failure** for all of them. Nothing checked the result, which is the only reason it went
  unnoticed. Rename now surfaces a real error instead of silently doing nothing.

**Deploy note:** run `supabase/v1.2.7-playlist-cover.sql`. Covers stay hidden until it's applied —
`get_my_playlists()` gains two columns and the client tolerates their absence.

## 1.2.6 — 2026-07-30 (web only — no desktop rebuild)

**Why the bump:** Zemer Radio shipped with the ordinary transport attached, which quietly offered
controls a broadcast can't honour.

**Zemer Radio — it now looks and behaves like live radio**
- **Stations have their own page at `/radio/:id`.** Tuning in used to drop you on the song page for
  whatever happened to be playing — but the song isn't what you picked, the station is. The page shows
  the station, what's on air, and what's coming, and the link is shareable.
- **A LIVE pill in the player** whenever you're tuned in.
- **The controls that can't work are gone rather than inert.** Seeking a shared broadcast would have
  silently desynced you from everyone else; scrubbing, ±15s, shuffle, repeat and queue reordering are
  hidden while a station plays, and every seek path — buttons, arrow keys, media keys, the tray —
  routes through one check that refuses with an explanation.
- The Up Next list on a station page is deliberately **not** clickable: you can't jump to a track
  inside a shared program, so offering it would be a lie.
- A line under the player explains that pausing leaves the broadcast and playing rejoins it live.

**Offline downloads — a stall now ends**
- A download that never reported back sat on "Preparing…" forever, because that state was only ever
  cleared by an event arriving. The same shape as the update-dialog bug. A download with no progress
  for three minutes now becomes a normal, retryable failure.

**Admin console**
- **Paging and sorting.** The list fetched 200 rows and said "200 of N" with no way to reach the rest —
  a limit that degrades quietly. Now 100 per page with prev/next and sortable name, email, created,
  last sign-in and PIN-failure columns.
- **The user modal is tabbed** — Settings / Activity / Playlists / Library — behind an identity header
  with an avatar and status chips, instead of one long scroll. Save and Clear PIN appear only on the
  tab they apply to.

## 1.2.5 — 2026-07-30 (web only — no desktop rebuild)

**Why the bump:** the admin console could show settings but not what a user actually has or does.

**Admin console**
- **Playlists** — every playlist the user has made, public/private, song count, last updated, and the
  full tracklist. These are owner-only under RLS; the admin RPC is what makes them visible.
- **Visits** — one entry per session: when it started, how long it ran, event and play counts, device,
  browser and location. `last sign-in` only tells you when a token was minted, which isn't the same as
  when someone was actually in the app.
- Both load independently of the settings panel, so a heavy account doesn't stall the modal.

**Limits, stated in the UI rather than left to look like a bug**
- Visits and play history only exist from 1.2.3 onward, and only while the person was **signed in**.
  Anonymous browsing by the same person can't be linked to the account — that's structural, not a gap
  to be filled later.

**Deploy note:** run `supabase/v1.2.5-admin-detail.sql`.

## 1.2.4 — 2026-07-30 (web only — no desktop rebuild)

**Why the bump:** a security review of the admin console found three single points of failure. None
was exploitable as configured — each was one setting away from silent full compromise.

- **Admin is now keyed on `auth.uid()`, not the JWT's `email` claim.** Email is the one identity
  attribute a user can ask the auth service to change. It wasn't forgeable only because "Confirm
  email" happens to be on — an unversioned dashboard setting nothing in the repo enforces. Turn it
  off to reduce signup friction and two requests would have granted admin.
- **Residual default table grants stripped.** `zemer_admin` and `zemer_user` had RLS enabled but their
  default privileges never revoked, so RLS default-deny was the *only* barrier. `anon` also held
  SELECT on `zemer_user` including `pin_hash` — every bcrypt PIN hash one RLS toggle away from a key
  that ships in the page source.
- `zemer_analytics` keeps **anon INSERT** deliberately: the beacon posts with the anon key. Everything
  else on that table is revoked.
- The migration **refuses to apply** if any `zemer_admin` row has no matching auth user, so a
  half-applied run can't lock every admin out.

**Deploy note:** run `supabase/v1.2.4-admin-hardening.sql`, then re-run `v1.2.2` and `v1.2.3`
(idempotent) to pick up the `search_path` alignment.

## 1.2.3 — 2026-07-30 (web only — no desktop rebuild)

**Why the bump:** analytics could not tell you *who* was listening — only that a tab was. Play events
now carry the signed-in account, which turns the admin console's listening view into a real history
and makes signed-in vs anonymous measurable.

**Analytics**
- **Play events are attributed to an account** when the listener is signed in. Signed-out events stay
  anonymous, and that absence is exactly what the new split measures.
- **New card at the top of the dashboard: signed in vs anonymous** — the share of *people* with an
  account, with the account/anonymous headcount and the share of events underneath. People and events
  are shown separately on purpose: accounts play far more per head, so the event split flatters them.
- **Every row in Recent events is marked `account` or `anon`** (hover an account chip for the id).
- **Admin console shows a real play history** — per song, with timestamps, for the last 90 days.

**Privacy / trust — worth being explicit about**
- The beacon is unauthenticated. The Worker takes the account id from the request body and does not
  verify it against a token (it holds only the anon key, and resolving a token per event would mean a
  round trip on every play). A hostile client can therefore post events tagged with someone else's id.
- That is acceptable **only** because this id is attribution and nothing else: it grants no access,
  gates no content, and is never read to make an authorization decision. It is exactly as trustworthy
  as the IP and user-agent already in the stream. It must not be extended into any access-control path.
- History only exists from this release forward. Older events were never attributed and can't be
  retroactively assigned; the console says so rather than showing a misleading empty list.

**Deploy note:** run `supabase/v1.2.3-analytics-identity.sql`. The Worker tolerates the gap — if the
column isn't there yet it retries the insert without it, so analytics keeps flowing either way.

## 1.2.2 — 2026-07-30 (web only — no desktop rebuild)

**Why the bump:** an admin console, so account problems can be fixed for a user instead of talked
through with them.

**Admin console (`/admin`)**
- A user table: name, email, filter summary, PIN state, Kid Zone, artist mode, PIN failures (with a
  lockout flag), created and last-sign-in dates. Search by name or email.
- Click a row for the full picture, with every content filter editable on the user's behalf —
  including the Zemer Radio policy, Kid Zone and artist mode. Edits stage and write on **Save**, so a
  mis-click isn't instantly live on someone's account.
- **Clear PIN** for a parent locked out of their own controls. An admin can clear a PIN but can never
  read or set one, so this can't be used to impersonate the parental gate.

**Sign-in**
- **Google sign-in on `/analytics` and `/admin`**, using the same Supabase project and provider as the
  app — admins use the account they already have. Password sign-in still works, and the session is
  shared between the two pages.
- Being in `zemer_admin` is what grants access. Signing in with Google grants nothing on its own.

**How it's actually secured** (the anon key is public, so the UI gates nothing)
- Every read and write goes through `admin_*` SECURITY DEFINER functions that re-check `zemer_admin`
  membership server-side on **every** call, with `execute` revoked from `anon` as a second layer.
- **`pin_hash` is never returned by any path** — admins see `has_pin` only.
- `admin_set_user` reads its patch key by key rather than merging, so a crafted key can't reach
  `pin_hash`, `id` or `email`.
- **Every admin write is logged** to a new `zemer_admin_audit` table with the acting admin and the
  before/after. One user editing another's parental controls without a trail shouldn't exist.

**Deploy note:** run `supabase/v1.2.2-admin.sql`, then add your email to `zemer_admin`.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-07-30 (web only — no desktop rebuild)

**Why the bump:** Zemer Radio shipped this morning with only an account-level on/off switch. A parent
needs to be able to make that decision for the account, and to make it stick.

**Parental Controls — Zemer Radio**
- A new **Zemer Radio** row in Parental Controls: **All**, a single named station (**Chassidish**,
  **Israeli**, **DJ**), or **Off**. Picking a station means that station is the *only* one the account
  ever sees; Off removes live radio entirely.
- **The policy outranks the account's own switch, and can only ever narrow.** Turning the personal
  switch on cannot re-enable radio a parent blocked; turning it off still works, because that's more
  restrictive, not less.
- With a PIN set, the Zemer Radio switch in Settings **locks and moves into "Locked by Parental
  Controls"**, like the other parent-set filters.
- **Changing the policy takes a station off air immediately** rather than at the end of the current
  track — if what's playing is no longer allowed, playback stops and the queue clears.
- The Parental Controls header shows the state at a glance (*Radio blocked* / *Radio · Chassidish*).
- Stored in the existing `filters` JSON alongside the Sefira rule, so it syncs across devices and
  survives sign-out with the rest of the cached policy. **No SQL migration.**

## 1.2.0 — 2026-07-30 (web only — no desktop rebuild)

**Why the bump:** a new listening surface. Zemer Radio — live, synchronized broadcast stations —
lands on Home. The desktop app picks it up automatically (it loads the web UI), so no new installer.

**Zemer Radio (new)**
- **Three live stations on Home** — Chassidish, Israeli, and DJ / Remix, from the upstream
  `zemer-search` stations service. These are a **broadcast**, not a playlist: one shared wall-clock
  program per station, so everyone tuned in hears the same song at the same moment. Tuning in seeks
  to wherever the broadcast currently is rather than starting the track over.
- Clock skew is measured on every schedule read (round-trip midpoint) so the seek lands in the right
  place even if the device clock is off. The local schedule tops itself up as the queue drains.
- **Pausing leaves the broadcast; playing again rejoins it live** — a radio station doesn't wait for
  you. Short interruptions (a seek, a buffer stall) are not treated as a pause.
- A takedown can leave a gap in the shared program (the server reports a negative offset — the next
  track *starts in* N ms). We wait it out instead of starting early and drifting out of sync.
- Starting a normal radio station, or playing anything else, leaves the broadcast cleanly.

**Zemer Radio and your filters**
- **New setting: Zemer Radio (on by default)** — one switch in Settings turns the whole row off. It
  isn't a content filter, so it needs no account.
- When it's on, **your content filters still choose which stations appear.** Hide Chasidish and the
  Chassidish station is gone; Only Chasidish and it's the only one left; the same for Israeli, and
  Hide DJ sets removes DJ / Remix.
- **Hidden entirely in Kid Zone** — the upstream station pools are not Kid-Zone filtered.
- **Hidden entirely in Acapella-only mode** (Sefira / the Three Weeks) — a station carries no
  acapella at all, so showing one would pipe instrumental music into an acapella-only session.
- Individual tracks are still re-checked against your own blocklist when you tune in.

**Worker**
- New same-origin proxy routes `/stations`, `/station` and `/stations/cover`, so the stations work
  behind a content filter. Each rebuilds the upstream query from a validated allowlist rather than
  forwarding the query string, matching the existing `/radio` hardening. `/station` is never cached
  (it carries the live playback offset); the card list gets 15s and the generated cover art 24h.

## 1.1.3 — 2026-07-28 (desktop only — no web change)

**Why the bump:** "Check for updates" could open the dialog and never tell you the answer. Reported
from the field on 1.1.2.

**Desktop — the update dialog always gives you a verdict**
- The dialog used to be at the mercy of timing. `open_update_window` returns as soon as the window is
  *created*, and the check starts in the same breath — so a check that resolved before `update.html`
  attached its listeners broadcast to nobody, leaving the dialog spinning "Checking for updates…"
  forever. Every phase is now recorded, and the dialog asks for the last one on load
  (`updater_last_status`), so it paints a result regardless of who won the race. A live event always
  beats the snapshot, so a stale status can never overwrite fresher news.
- **Clicking during the startup check no longer does nothing.** The 8-seconds-after-launch check held
  a "already running" guard that made a user-initiated click return *silently* — dialog open, no
  events, no verdict. It now re-announces the checking phase, and the in-flight check's own result
  still lands on the dialog.
- **A failed background check now reports.** `updater://error` was only emitted for user-initiated
  checks, so a silent failure left the next dialog sitting on a stale phase. It's emitted either way
  now; the `userInitiated` flag in the payload still decides whether the SPA surfaces it.

## 1.1.2 — 2026-07-28 (web + desktop)

Playlist polish, clearer download status, and two desktop fixes: off-site links were dead in the app
window, and the update check was buried in the tray. The desktop build is bumped to **1.1.2** so the
installer, the About page and the announced version all read the same number — 1.1.2 was originally
cut as a web-only release, which is why no `desktop-v1.1.2` existed on GitHub.

**Desktop — links open in your browser**
- **Every off-site link now works.** GitHub, jtechforums, the GPL text, the Tampermonkey links on the
  add-on page — inside the app window these previously did nothing at all (a native window has no
  tabs for `target="_blank"`, and a same-window jump would have replaced SK Music itself). They now
  open in your default browser. SK Music's own pages still open in the app, and the Google sign-in
  redirect deliberately stays in the app window — it has to come back with your session.

**Desktop — updates on the About page**
- **"Check for updates" now lives on About**, with the installed version next to it, instead of only
  in the tray menu. It opens the same update dialog. (The tray item is still there.)

**Playlists**
- **Share a playlist** — a Share button on your playlist page toggles it **public/private** and, when
  public, gives you **Copy link** / **Send link**. Public playlists open read-only at `/p/<id>` for
  anyone with the link (no account needed), still filtered by the viewer's own content settings.
- **No accidental duplicates** — adding a song that's already in a playlist is a no-op, and the
  Add-to-playlist menu now **greys out** the playlists it's already in (shows "✓ Added").
- **In-app modal** — creating, renaming, and deleting a playlist (and reporting a song) now use a
  styled in-app dialog instead of the browser's `prompt()`/`confirm()`.

**Downloads (desktop)**
- The Now Playing download button now clearly shows **downloading / done / failed** state (failed turns
  red — click to retry), and a failed download surfaces the actual reason in the toast.

**Deploy note:** run `supabase/v1.1.2-playlists.sql` (after `v1.1.0-features.sql`) — it adds the
`is_public` column and the sharing / "already added" RPCs. Sharing and grey-out stay inert until then.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-07-28 (desktop + web)

Follow-up fixes on top of 1.1.0.

**Desktop — mini player**
- The mini player is now **display-aware**. On a **single monitor** it still pops up when the main
  window loses focus (you switched to another app that covers it) — the classic behavior. On a
  **multi-monitor** setup it no longer pops on focus loss (the main window is usually still visible on
  another screen); there it surfaces only when you **minimize**. This fixes two multi-monitor annoyances:
  **dragging** the window briefly flickered the mini, and **clicking another screen** popped it even
  though the main window was fully visible. Minimize/restore is detected authoritatively (via the resize
  event, since minimizing can report focus-loss before the minimized flag flips), and close-to-tray
  still surfaces the mini explicitly. Monitor count is checked live, so plugging/unplugging a display
  is picked up immediately.

**Desktop / web — tray radio**
- The tray's radio item now reads **"Start radio"** when nothing is playing (and **"Start radio from
  this song"** once a track is active). Clicking it with nothing playing now starts a generic mix
  instead of doing nothing. (Label updates live from the now-playing state.)

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-28 (web + desktop)

**Why the bump:** the first big *feature* release since 1.0 — playback UX, a real
library/sharing layer, discovery, and desktop offline downloads. Everything is additive and
gated so nothing changes for users who don't opt in.

**Playback UX**
- **Shuffle mode** — a persistent toggle in Now Playing. Shuffles the not-yet-played tail in
  place, so the gapless/next path keeps working unchanged.
- **Sleep timer** — pause after 15/30/45/60 min, or at the end of the current song. 🌙
- **Queue editor** — the Up Next list is now drag-to-reorder, with per-row *Play next* and
  *Remove*.
- **Crossfade** — optional 3/6/9/12-second fade between songs, extending the dual-player
  engine. Off by default; the tuned gapless handoff is untouched when it's off. Manual
  transport aborts a fade; pause finishes it and pauses the new track.
- **Time-synced lyrics** — a Lyrics tab in Now Playing (LRCLIB via the Worker's `/lyrics`),
  with the active line highlighted and tap-to-seek; falls back to plain lyrics or a tidy
  "no lyrics found."

**Library & sharing**
- **User playlists** — create/rename/delete, add songs, server-backed via Supabase so they
  sync across devices (RPCs in `supabase/v1.1.0-features.sql`).
- **Follow an artist** — a Follow button on artist pages; followed artists' newest releases
  surface in a "New from artists you follow" shelf on For You.
- **Share a song** — share sheet (native share or copy link) from the song menu and Now Playing.
- **Offline downloads (desktop app)** — save a song's audio for offline playback. A hidden
  youtube.com webview has YouTube's own player mint the signed audio-only stream URL (no
  yt-dlp, no signature forging), Rust downloads it in ranged chunks, and a `skdl://` scheme
  serves it to the html5 `<audio>` element. New Downloads library + a download button in Now
  Playing. Entirely `SK_NATIVE`-gated — invisible on the web.

**Content ops**
- **Report a problem** — flag any song from the song menu; reports land in a Supabase review queue.
- **Tagging progress** — a "Help improve the catalog" card in the Library shows Israeli/Chasidish
  tag coverage, with contributor links for signed-in users.

**Discovery**
- **Search history & saved searches** — recent searches and starrable saved searches on the
  search landing.
- **Per-song radio + "Fans also like"** — start a radio station from any song's menu; artist
  pages gain a similar-artists shelf.
- **Better For You** — "Artists you've been playing" (recently-played) and "New from artists
  you follow" shelves.

**Login merge**
- Likes and history now **merge** (union) with the account on sign-in instead of overwriting —
  DB entries are never clobbered (idempotent `set_like`).

**Deploy notes (for the maintainer)**
- Run `supabase/v1.1.0-features.sql` in the Supabase dashboard (4 tables + 12 RPCs; idempotent).
- Redeploy the web app so the CSP `media-src` change (adds `skdl:`) ships — the desktop app
  needs it to play downloaded files.

## desktop-v1.0.2 — 2026-07-28

**Why the bump:** a security + reliability hardening pass — three parallel audit agents (web player,
desktop shell, Worker) plus a login-merge audit, with every actionable finding fixed. No new
features; the app gets safer and more robust.

**Content-filter correctness (kosher-critical):**
- The empty-queue resume path now re-gates the saved track before replaying (a filter could have
  changed since it was saved).
- Changing a filter now re-gates the **live** play queue — blocked tracks can't keep auto-advancing.
- Upstream-fed rails (trending / new releases / Zemer home-rows / cold-start) fail **closed** on an
  unresolved artist (`gateFeed`): `hiddenArtist` fails open on names that don't match our catalog, so
  an unmatched female/blocked artist could have slipped in. Verified it drops only truly-unknown
  artists — the real trending content is untouched.
- Radio continuation pages carry the current filter fingerprint (a mid-station filter change no
  longer serves under the old filter).

**Playback robustness:**
- Gapless handoff **watchdog** — a swap whose PLAYING confirmation never arrives no longer silently
  wedges playback at a track boundary.
- Pausing in the final half-second no longer lets the fire window un-pause the song.
- Seeks **verify-retry** (YouTube's iframe silently swallows `seekTo` while buffering); a skip that
  lands paused is nudged back into playback.
- Listen-time is banked (not destroyed) when the window is backgrounded — the always-open desktop
  app no longer under-counts plays.
- The queue registry is now LRU-capped (was an unbounded memory leak over a long session).

**Security hardening:**
- Every upstream id is validated (`safeId`) and thumbnail URL escaped before it reaches an inline
  handler — closes a stored-XSS surface from a poisoned upstream.
- Desktop: the tray-menu popup no longer holds its mutex across the blocking modal loop (a
  self-deadlock the tray left-click could trigger); `update.html` renders update fields via
  `textContent` with a CSP (a forged `updater://` event can't inject markup); the remote-origin
  capability grant is trimmed to event emit/listen only.
- Worker: `/radio` and `/playlist` are GET-only with validated/bounded params; the analytics beacon
  caps `meta` size; the service worker no longer activates an empty cache on a failed install.

**Desktop reliability:**
- Mini player recovers if a monitor change stranded it off-screen; taskbar jump-list actions work on
  a **cold** start (not just when the app is already running); the updater has a 30 s timeout and a
  drop-guard so a stalled check can't wedge "Check for updates" shut; a staged update isn't
  re-downloaded daily; tray lock poisoning self-heals instead of freezing the tray permanently.

**Account merge (idempotent):**
- Signed-out likes and listening history **merge** into the account on login as a true union — DB
  entries are never overwritten or deleted, local-only entries are added, and the local store becomes
  the union. Likes now use an idempotent `set_like(videoId, liked)` RPC (deploy
  `supabase/set-like-idempotent.sql`) instead of a non-idempotent flip, so re-logins and multiple
  devices can't double-flip or lose a like. A "Merged N liked songs" toast confirms the merge.
- Mini player: repeat-one button, keyboard control while focused, click-to-seek; the collapsed
  tiny-box mode was removed. Tray left-click surfaces the mini and pops the full menu.


Version numbers track the **desktop app** (`Desktop/src-tauri`); the web app deploys continuously
from `main`, so web changes are listed under the desktop release they shipped alongside. Desktop
releases live at `desktop-v<version>` tags with signed installers; installed apps self-update from
them via the `/updates` route.

## desktop-v1.0.1 — 2026-07-28

**Why the bump:** first post-1.0 patch — two playback reliability fixes reported within hours of
1.0.0, plus a tray interaction change.

- Tray **left-click** now surfaces the mini player *and* pops the full menu (double-click opens the
  main app). Menu popups anchor on a visible window so a tray-hidden main window can't auto-dismiss
  them.
- Web: seeks are **verify-retried** — the YouTube iframe occasionally swallows a `seekTo`
  (confirmed live: an identical seek landed once and was silently ignored seconds later), so the
  handler confirms the position moved and re-issues up to twice.
- Web: a skip that lands **paused** (YouTube's `loadVideoById` sometimes settles cued instead of
  autoplaying) is nudged back into playback ~2 s later; intentional pauses cancel the nudge.

## desktop-v1.0.0 — 2026-07-28

**Why the bump:** the mini player and the platform around it reached "deserves a version number"
quality — everything below (0.2.x) was the run-up. 1.0.0 itself simplified the mini player: the
collapsed tiny-box mode was **removed** (it bred its own bug class), the progress bar became
**click-to-seek** (slim visual, 14 px hit target), and the mini is fully **keyboard-drivable**
(Space/K play-pause, ←→ or N/P skip, L like, O/Enter open app, Esc close).

- Web (same push): the About page gained a real feature list.

## desktop-v0.2.3 — 2026-07-28

**Why the bump:** the release that made the desktop app actually *work* — the metadata bridge had
been silently dead in every release build since 0.1.x.

- **Release-mode bridge fix:** remote origins (the deployed SPA the window loads) cannot invoke
  Tauri app commands — the ACL denies them silently, and dev builds masked it because `devUrl` made
  the site the app's own origin. The webview now reports playback via **events**
  (`sk-np-report`/`sk-state-report`/`sk-menu`), which the remote grant does allow; Rust listens and
  routes into the same handlers. This is why the tray/mini said "Not playing" during playback.
- **Taskbar jump list** (Windows): Play/Pause, Next, Previous, Like, Start radio, Mini player,
  Check for updates — tasks relaunch the exe with `--control=<action>`, forwarded by
  single-instance to the running app.
- Close-to-tray explicitly auto-shows the mini (hiding a window emits no focus event).
- Tiny-box play/expand buttons fixed (an `::after` overlay swallowed their clicks).
- **Crisp icons**: the full icon set regenerated from the vector logo at 1024 px; the tray
  Lanczos-downscales its own 32 px icon instead of letting Windows crush the full-size one.
- Web (same day): empty-queue Play resumes the last listen (≤ 20 min) or starts the trending mix;
  right-click in the desktop app pops the tray menu.

## desktop-v0.2.2 — 2026-07-28

**Why the bump:** the mini player rework + the fix for it loading the wrong content entirely.

- **Mini player fixed and redesigned.** In 0.2.1 the mini window could load the *full web app*
  instead of `mini.html` (`devUrl` hijacked local-asset resolution; the asset protocol's
  `index.html` fallback then bootstrapped the remote site — also why it couldn't be dragged).
  `devUrl` removed; the bootstrap refuses to hand off any window that isn't `main`. New layout:
  art flush-left, one-line title + artist, like/transport/elapsed-of-total, drag anywhere,
  double-click opens the app.
- **Auto-show:** while music plays, unfocusing or minimizing the main window shows the mini
  (without stealing focus); focusing it again hides an auto-shown mini. Tray toggle, default on.
- Updater re-checks **daily**, not just at startup.
- Quit destroys all webviews before exiting so WebView2 releases its profile locks (the
  freeze-on-fast-relaunch fix).
- Web (same day): the desktop bridge contract (queue for Up Next, `like`/`radio`/`playindex`/
  `resumecheck` actions with post-sleep self-heal).

## desktop-v0.2.1 — 2026-07-28

**Why the bump:** "Check for updates" got a face — a status dialog showing the installed version
and narrating the check live (spinner, up-to-date, downloading with progress + release notes,
restart-to-update button) instead of a silent background check.

## desktop-v0.2.0 — 2026-07-28

**Why the bump:** the desktop app went from "shell" to "desktop citizen" — seven features in one
agent-built batch: the first mini player, Start with Windows (launches hidden to tray), tray
Like/Start-radio items, a tray icon that shows playback state, the Up Next tray submenu, optional
track-change toasts, and sleep/resume self-heal (wall-clock vs monotonic drift detection →
`resumecheck` into the webview).

- Web (same day, the run-up): **gapless playback** (double-buffer prime, ~200 ms handoffs),
  **Zemer Radio** everywhere (song/artist/album/playlist stations, Radio mode, queue-end Autoplay
  with prefetch), **real release dates** from the upstream feed, For You cold start from the
  telemetry top-50, artist-page A–Z strip + downsized thumbnails, kind back-button behavior,
  youtube-nocookie embeds (clean console).

## desktop-v0.1.2 — 2026-07-13

Analytics-era maintenance release of the original shell (pre-dates this changelog's detail level).

## desktop-v0.1.1 — 2026-07-13

Early shell fixes (pre-dates this changelog's detail level).

## desktop-v0.1.0 — 2026-07-12

First desktop release: the Tauri 2 shell around the deployed web app — system tray with
close-to-tray background play, OS media keys / SMTC, `skmusic://` deep links, signed auto-updater.

## v1.0.0 (web) — 2026-07-09

The original web release: whitelisted catalog, client-side Hebrew-aware search, YouTube-iframe
playback, content filters + parental controls, Kid Zone, charts, PWA.
